# Multiplex cinema management.

A multiplex cinema is composed of several rooms, each room may show a different movie, with a different schedule. Each room has a specific seat capacity, to be strictly enforced for safety regulations.

Each seat in a room has an id. A management system for a multiplex cinema has to be built because there are several multiplex cinemas across Italy.

The management system will be used by clerks to sell tickets at a counter in the cinema. The sale of a ticket can also be done via Internet, the customers buy it connecting to a web site. A ticket is valid for a specific seat, in a specific room, for a specific show (movie and start time).

A ticket is unique and has a bar code. The ticket must be printed to guarantee admission. A ticket is sold only in the same day of the show, and only if there is a seat available. The user can choose the seat. A ticket is refundable, if not used.

Another function of the system is admitting (or rejecting) people to the rooms. Admission is regulated by a gate, which opens after showing a valid ticket to a bar code reader. There is a first row of gates controlling access to all rooms, then a gate controlling access to each room.

Other functions supported by the system are refund of a ticket various monitor functions for the clerks (how many persons are in a room, how many seats available for a room/movie session, average occupation of a room per day/ per session); definition of the schedule for the day (what movie for what room at what time); printout of the schedule of the day.
